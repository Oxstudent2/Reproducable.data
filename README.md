# Reproducable.data

This reporsitory contains folders with functions for use in the rmd

To access the code, open ReproducabilityCode.rmd

The following folders are created automatically in the code:

- AssignmentFigures <- do not need to load data into, is just the folder for images to be saved to
- PlottingAssignment
- NewFunctions

After creating these files, downlaod the R scripts found in each file in the REPO and open them in the corresponding file in the RSTUDIO DIRECTORY. 
AssignmentFigures and PlottingAssignemnt contain the scripts with functions for the reproducability code - they must be loaded so the code can run crrectly.

This ensures the functions are in the correct place to be used and so the code can run.
