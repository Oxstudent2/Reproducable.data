# Reproducable.data

The code to run is ReproducabilityCode. To run this code effectively, ensure the following folders are created in the working directory opened:

- AssignmentFunctions
- NewFunctions
- PlottingAssignment
- data
- AssigmentFigures

After creating these files, downlaod the R scripts found in each file and open them in the corresponding file in the directory. These scripts contain the functions for the reproducability code - they must be loaded so the code can run crrectly.

This ensures the functions are in the correct place to be used and so the code can run.
