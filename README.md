# Reproducable.data

This reporsitory contains folders with functions for use in the rmd

To access the code, open 

The following folders created in the code:

- AssignmentFigures
- PlottingAssignment
- NewFunctions

After creating these files, downlaod the R scripts found in each file in the REPO and open them in the corresponding file in the RSTUDIO DIRECTORY. These files contain the scripts with functions for the reproducability code - they must be loaded so the code can run crrectly.

This ensures the functions are in the correct place to be used and so the code can run.
