# Reproducable.data

The code to run for is ReproducabilityCode. To run this code effectively, ensure the following folders are created on your computer:
- AssignmentFunctions
- NewFunctions
- PlottingAssignment
- data

After creating these files, downlaod the R scripts found in each file and save them to the corresponding file created on the computer. These scripts contain the functions for the reproducability code that must be loaded so the code can run crrectly.

This ensures the functions are in the correct place to be used and so the code can run.
